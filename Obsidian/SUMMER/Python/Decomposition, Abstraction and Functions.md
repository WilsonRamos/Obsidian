 - Abstraccion actually enables the decomposition

### BIG IDEA
-> **Apply abstraccion(black box) and decomposition (split into self-contained parts) to programming**

A function has specification, capture using docstring
### BIG IDEAS
-> Solve a simpler problem firts
	add functionality to the code later
### BIG IDEAS
-> Test code often. 
	use print to debug

Sumary :
* Functions allow us to suppress detail from a user
* Function capture computation within a black box
